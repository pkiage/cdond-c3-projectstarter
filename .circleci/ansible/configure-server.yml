  # B2. Configure Infrastructure (1.b)
  # Keep your playbook clean and maintainable by using roles.
  # You will need to decide what roles to create and how to split up your code.

  # In one of the roles
  ## Install Python (already done in pre_tasks here)
  ## Update/upgrade packages
  ## Install nodejs, npm, and pm2

  # Tips:
  ## Read project/.circleci/ansible/roles/configure-server/tasks/readme.md
  roles:
    - configure-server
